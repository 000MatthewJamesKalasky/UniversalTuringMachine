## About
The Universal Turing Machine is an application written in *C\#(.NET 5)* in which you can simulate any turing machine .<br>
(**Important Note:** This app supports **ONLY** **deterministic** turing machines so make sure that your turing machine is deterministic. )

The [.NET 5 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime) is required to use the application .

To learn how to use the application read the [**Documentation**](Documentation.pdf) .
